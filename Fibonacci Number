Get the Kth number in the Fibonacci Sequence. (K is 0-indexed, the 0th Fibonacci number is 0 and the 1st Fibonacci number is 1).

Examples

0th fibonacci number is 0
1st fibonacci number is 1
2nd fibonacci number is 1
3rd fibonacci number is 2
6th fibonacci number is 8
Corner Cases

What if K < 0? in this case, we should always return 0.
Is it possible the result fibonacci number is overflowed? We can assume it will not be overflowed when we solve this problem on this online judge,
but we should also know that it is possible to get an overflowed number, and sometimes we will need to use something like BigInteger.


Solution: 
Assumption: 
1. k<0 
2. overflow so that we return long 

Time complexity: O(n^2) 对于每个n 需要call 两次自己. 总次数n^2
Space complexity: O(k-1 + k-2) = O(k) 

public class SolutionI {
  public long fibonacci(int K) {
    // Write your solution here
    // sanity check and base case
    if (K <= 0) {
      return 0;
    } else if (K == 1) {
      return 1;
    }
    // recursion rule 
    return fibonacci(K - 1) + fibonacci(K - 2);
  }
}


Time complexity: O(k)
Space complexity: O(k) 

public class Solution {
  public long fibonacci(int K) {
    // sanity check 
    if (K <= 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    if (K == 1) {
      return 1;
    }
    
    long[] array = new long[K + 1];
    array[0] = 0;
    array[1] = 1; 
    
    for (int i = 2; i < K + 1; i++) {
      array[i] = array[i - 1] + array[i - 2];
    }
    return array[K];
  }
}

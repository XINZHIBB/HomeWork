Find all numbers that appear in both of two sorted arrays (the two arrays are all sorted in ascending order).

Assumptions

In each of the two sorted arrays, there could be duplicate numbers.
Both two arrays are not null.
Examples

A = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3}, B = {1, 1, 2, 5, 6}, common numbers are [1, 1, 2]

Solution:
two pointer; 
Step1: create two pointer i, j for A and B. 
Step2: two pointers move from the first elemnt to the last element. 
       case1: A[i] == B[j] then i++, j++, add this element to the result array. 
       case2: A[i] < B[j] then i++ 
       case3: A[i] > B[j] then j++
Step3: repeat Step2 until i or j reach the end of  the array.

Given a number of different denominations of coins (e.g., 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents), 

get all the possible ways to pay a target number of cents.

Arguments

coins - an array of positive integers representing the different denominations of coins, 
there are no duplicate numbers and the numbers are sorted by descending order, eg. {25, 10, 5, 2, 1}
target - a positive integer representing the target number of cents, eg. 99
Assumptions

coins is not null and is not empty, all the numbers in coins are positive
target >= 0
You have infinite number of coins for each of the denominations, you can pick any number of the coins.
Return

a list of ways of combinations of coins to sum up to be target.
each way of combinatoins is represented by list of integer, the number at each index means
the number of coins used for the denomination at corresponding index.
Examples

coins = {2, 1}, target = 4, the return should be

[

  [0, 4],   (4 cents can be conducted by 0 * 2 cents + 4 * 1 cents)

  [1, 2],   (4 cents can be conducted by 1 * 2 cents + 2 * 1 cents)

  [2, 0]    (4 cents can be conducted by 2 * 2 cents + 0 * 1 cents)

]

Solution:

4 layers 
each layer indicates one kind of coins 
each layer calculate the number of this kind of coin used and pass the rest down
 
public class Solution {
  public List<List<Integer>> combinations(int target, int[] coins) {
    // Write your solution here.
    List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();
    ArrayList<Integer> cur = new ArrayList<Integer>(); 
    helper(target, 0, coins, cur, result); 
    return result;
  }
  
  private void helper(int target, int index, int[] coins, List<Integer> cur, List<List<Integer>> result) {
    if (index == coins.length - 1) {
      if (target % coins[index] == 0) {
        cur.add(target / coins[index]); 
        result.add(new ArrayList<Integer>(cur));
        cur.remove(cur.size() - 1);
      }
      return; 
    }
    
    for(int i = 0; i <= target / coins[index]; i++) {
      cur.add(i); 
      helper(target - coins[index] * i, index + 1, coins, cur, result);
      cur.remove(cur.size()-1); 
    }
  }
  
}
